# Online Shop Project
A fully featured online shop.
The online shop will enable clients to browse products, add them to the cart, apply discount codes, go through the checkout process, pay with credit card, and obtain an invoice. It will also include a recommendation engine to recommend products to customers, and we will use internationalization to offer the site in multiple languages.

## Highlights 
- Create a product catalog
- Build a shopping cart using Django sessions
- Create custom context processors
- Manage customer orders
- Configure Celery with RabbitMQ as our message broker
- Send asynchronous notifications to customers using Celery
- Monitor Celery using Flower
